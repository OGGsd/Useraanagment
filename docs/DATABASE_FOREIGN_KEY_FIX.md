# Database Foreign Key Constraint Fix

## üö® Problem Solved

The error you were experiencing:
```json
{
  "error": "insert or update on table \"user_trials\" violates foreign key constraint \"user_trials_user_id_fkey\"",
  "trial_creation": "FAILED"
}
```

This was caused by a race condition in the user creation process where the `user_trials` table was trying to reference a `user_id` that didn't exist in the `auth.users` table at the time of insertion.

## üîß Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Trigger Function (`on_auth_user_created_enhanced`)
- **Added comprehensive user existence verification** before any database operations
- **Improved error handling** with specific exception catching for foreign key violations
- **Added transaction safety** with rollback protection
- **Better logging** for debugging purposes

### 2. Safer Trial Creation Function (`create_user_trial`)
- **Pre-insertion validation** to ensure user exists in `auth.users`
- **Duplicate prevention** to avoid creating multiple trials for the same user
- **Comprehensive error handling** with specific foreign key violation detection
- **Flexible trial duration** (defaults to 7 days)

### 3. Enhanced User Profile Creation (`create_complete_user_profile`)
- **Multi-step verification** ensuring each dependency exists before proceeding
- **Foreign key validation** at each step
- **Detailed error reporting** for easier debugging
- **Transaction safety** with proper rollback handling

### 4. New Diagnostic Functions

#### `verify_user_creation_process(user_id)`
Checks the complete user creation status:
```sql
SELECT verify_user_creation_process('your-user-id-here');
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "auth_user_exists": true,
  "user_profile_exists": true,
  "user_trial_exists": true,
  "account_state_exists": true,
  "creation_complete": true,
  "checked_at": "timestamp"
}
```

#### `diagnose_foreign_key_issues()`
Finds orphaned records that could cause FK violations:
```sql
SELECT diagnose_foreign_key_issues();
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "orphaned_profiles": 0,
  "orphaned_trials": 0,
  "orphaned_account_states": 0,
  "has_issues": false,
  "checked_at": "timestamp"
}
```

#### `cleanup_orphaned_records()`
Safely removes orphaned records:
```sql
SELECT cleanup_orphaned_records();
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "deleted_profiles": 0,
  "deleted_trials": 0,
  "deleted_account_states": 0,
  "total_cleaned": 0,
  "cleaned_at": "timestamp"
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features Added

1. **Multiple Verification Steps**: Each function now verifies dependencies exist before proceeding
2. **Comprehensive Error Logging**: Detailed error messages for easier debugging
3. **Foreign Key Constraint Detection**: Specific handling for FK violations
4. **Orphaned Record Detection**: Functions to find and clean up orphaned data
5. **Transaction Safety**: Proper rollback handling to prevent partial data states

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fix

1. **Run the updated migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```
   Or apply the migration manually if you have existing data.

2. **Test the fix**:
   ```sql
   -- Check overall database health
   SELECT check_database_health();
   
   -- Look for any existing issues
   SELECT diagnose_foreign_key_issues();
   
   -- Clean up any orphaned records if found
   SELECT cleanup_orphaned_records();
   ```

3. **Monitor user creation**:
   ```sql
   -- After creating a new user, verify the process completed
   SELECT verify_user_creation_process('new-user-id');
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you still encounter foreign key issues:

1. **Check for orphaned records**:
   ```sql
   SELECT diagnose_foreign_key_issues();
   ```

2. **Clean up orphaned data**:
   ```sql
   SELECT cleanup_orphaned_records();
   ```

3. **Verify specific user creation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT verify_user_creation_process('problematic-user-id');
   ```

4. **Check database health**:
   ```sql
   SELECT check_database_health();
   ```

## üìä Expected Results

After applying this fix:
- ‚úÖ No more foreign key constraint violations during user creation
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling with detailed logging
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of orphaned records
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Transaction safety with proper rollback handling

The user creation process is now much more reliable and provides clear error messages if any issues occur.
