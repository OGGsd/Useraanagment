FROM team_members tm
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON tm.user_id = up.id
WHERE tm.team_id IN (
  SELECT t.id FROM teams t
  JOIN auth.users u ON t.admin_user_id = u.id
  WHERE u.email = 'stefanjohnmiranda3@gmail.com'
)
ORDER BY tm.created_at DESC;

  SELECT t.id FROM teams t
  JOIN auth.users u ON t.admin_user_id = u.id

)
ORDER BY ts.created_at DESC;

  t.id,
  t.name,
  t.admin_user_id,
  t.status,
  'No admin user found' as issue

  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,

-- 6. Test if you can access teams table directly
SELECT 
  'DIRECT TEAMS ACCESS TEST' as check_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_teams,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN admin_user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'stefanjohnmiranda3@gmail.com') THEN 1 END) as your_teams
FROM teams;

-- 7. Check if the bulletproof function was created successfully
SELECT 
  'FUNCTION CHECK' as check_type,
