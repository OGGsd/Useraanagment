-- 3. CREATE TEAM AUDIT LOG TABLE (if not exists)

ALTER TABLE team_audit_log ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Team audit log access" ON team_audit_log
  FOR ALL USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT id FROM teams WHERE admin_user_id = auth.uid())
  );

-- 5. GRANT NECESSARY PERMISSIONS
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION update_team_member_password TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_team_member_account TO authenticated;

-- 6. VERIFICATION QUERIES
SELECT 'Team management functions created successfully!' as status;

-- Test that functions exist
SELECT

  security_type
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('update_team_member_password', 'delete_team_member_account')
