# üß™ COMPREHENSIVE SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM TEST SUITE

## üéØ **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

### ‚úÖ **Fix 1: Webhook Deduplication**
- Added `webhook_events` table to prevent duplicate processing
- Each Stripe event is recorded and checked before processing

### ‚úÖ **Fix 2: Payment Failure Handling**
- Added `handlePaymentFailure()` for `invoice.payment_failed` events
- Users get 7-day grace period when payments fail
- Trial status set to `payment_failed`

### ‚úÖ **Fix 3: Payment Recovery Handling**
- Added `handlePaymentSuccess()` for `invoice.payment_succeeded` events
- Automatically restores access when payment succeeds after failure
- Clears deletion schedules and restores `converted_to_paid` status

### ‚úÖ **Fix 4: Enhanced Subscription Status Handling**
- Improved logging and error handling in webhook
- Better fallback mechanisms if new functions fail

## üß™ **TEST SCENARIOS TO VALIDATE:**

### **Test Suite 1: Basic Subscription Flow ‚úÖ**
```
1. New User Registration
   - User signs up ‚Üí Gets 7-day free trial
   - Status: trial_status = 'active', access_type = 'free_trial'

2. Trial to Subscription
   - User subscribes during trial ‚Üí Gets paid subscription
   - Status: trial_status = 'converted_to_paid', access_type = 'paid_subscription'

3. Subscription Cancellation
   - User cancels ‚Üí Subscription marked for end of period
   - Status: trial_status = 'canceled', deletion scheduled after period end

4. Trial Expiration
   - Trial expires without subscription ‚Üí Account scheduled for deletion
   - Status: trial_status = 'expired', deletion scheduled
```

### **Test Suite 2: Critical Edge Cases üö®**
```
5. Rapid Cancel/Resubscribe (RACE CONDITION TEST)
   - User subscribes ‚Üí Immediately cancels ‚Üí Immediately resubscribes
   - Expected: Final status should be 'paid_subscription'
   - Test: Perform actions within 30 seconds

6. Payment Failure During Active Subscription
   - User has active subscription ‚Üí Card expires ‚Üí Payment fails
   - Expected: Status changes to 'payment_failed', 7-day grace period
   - Test: Simulate with Stripe test cards

7. Payment Recovery
   - User in 'payment_failed' status ‚Üí Updates card ‚Üí Payment succeeds
   - Expected: Status restored to 'converted_to_paid', access restored

8. Multiple Subscriptions (CONFLICT TEST)
   - User somehow gets multiple active subscriptions
   - Expected: System should handle gracefully, keep latest
```

### **Test Suite 3: Webhook Reliability üîÑ**
```
9. Webhook Deduplication
   - Same Stripe event sent multiple times
   - Expected: Only processed once, subsequent calls ignored

10. Webhook Failure Recovery
   - Webhook fails ‚Üí Stripe retries ‚Üí Should process correctly
   - Expected: No duplicate processing, correct final state

11. Out-of-Order Webhooks
   - Webhooks arrive in wrong order (update before create)
   - Expected: System handles gracefully, final state correct
```

## üîç **MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST:**

### **Pre-Test Setup:**
- [ ] Ensure only one webhook endpoint configured in Stripe
- [ ] Verify webhook secret is correct
- [ ] Check database has latest migrations applied
- [ ] Confirm all Edge Functions are deployed

### **Test 1: Basic Subscription Flow**
- [ ] Create new user account
- [ ] Verify 7-day trial starts automatically
- [ ] Subscribe during trial period
- [ ] Verify status changes to 'paid_subscription'
- [ ] Cancel subscription
- [ ] Verify cancellation scheduled correctly
- [ ] Resubscribe before period ends
- [ ] Verify status returns to 'paid_subscription'

### **Test 2: Payment Failure Simulation**
- [ ] Use Stripe test card: `4000000000000341` (card_declined)
- [ ] Create subscription with failing card
- [ ] Verify payment failure is handled correctly
- [ ] Update to working card: `4242424242424242`
- [ ] Verify payment success restores access

### **Test 3: Race Condition Testing**
- [ ] Open browser dev tools to monitor API calls
- [ ] Perform rapid cancel ‚Üí resubscribe (< 30 seconds)
- [ ] Check webhook logs in Supabase Functions
- [ ] Verify final state is correct
- [ ] Check for any duplicate processing

## üö® **CRITICAL MONITORING POINTS:**

### **Database Checks:**
```sql
-- Check for webhook deduplication
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webhook_events WHERE created_at > now() - interval '1 hour';

-- Check for users in payment_failed status
SELECT user_id, trial_status, deletion_scheduled_at 
FROM user_trials 
WHERE trial_status = 'payment_failed';

-- Check for subscription conflicts
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as subscription_count
FROM stripe_subscriptions 
WHERE status IN ('active', 'trialing') 
AND deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### **Webhook Monitoring:**
- Monitor Stripe webhook delivery success rate
- Check Supabase Function logs for errors
- Verify webhook processing times (should be < 5 seconds)

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

### **‚úÖ All Tests Must Pass:**
1. **No duplicate webhook processing** - Each event processed exactly once
2. **Payment failures handled gracefully** - Users get grace period, access restored on recovery
3. **Race conditions resolved** - Rapid actions result in correct final state
4. **No paying customers deleted** - Protection functions work correctly
5. **Subscription conflicts resolved** - Multiple subscriptions handled properly

### **üìä Performance Targets:**
- Webhook processing: < 5 seconds
- Database queries: < 1 second
- User state updates: Real-time (< 2 seconds)

## üöÄ **POST-IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING:**

### **Daily Checks:**
- [ ] Review webhook delivery success rate
- [ ] Check for users stuck in 'payment_failed' status
- [ ] Monitor subscription conflict resolution
- [ ] Verify protection functions running correctly

### **Weekly Reviews:**
- [ ] Analyze subscription flow metrics
- [ ] Review edge case handling effectiveness
- [ ] Check for new race condition patterns
- [ ] Validate revenue protection measures
